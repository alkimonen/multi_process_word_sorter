The next portion of the spectrum of interest is
the infrared (IR) region which covers the
wavelength range from approximately 0.7 μm
to 100 μm - more than 100 times as wide as
the visible portion! The infrared region can be
divided into two categories based on their
radiation properties - the reflected IR, and
the emitted or thermal IR. Radiation in the
reflected IR region is used for remote sensing
purposes in ways very similar to radiation in
the visible portion. The reflected IR covers
wavelengths from approximately 0.7 μm to
3.0 μm. The thermal IR region is quite
different than the visible and reflected IR
portions, as this energy is essentially the
radiation that is emitted from the Earth's
surface in the form of heat. The thermal IR
covers wavelengths from approximately 3.0
μm to 100 μm.
The portion of the spectrum of more recent
interest to remote sensing is the microwave
region from about 1 mm to 1 m. This covers
the longest wavelengths used for remote
sensing. The shorter wavelengths have
properties similar to the thermal infrared
region while the longer wavelengths approach
the wavelengths used for radio broadcasts.
Because of the special nature of this region
and its importance to remote sensing in
Canada, an entire chapter (Chapter 3) of the
tutorial is dedicated to microwave sensing.
